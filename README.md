#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is designing, building, testing, and maintaining software using structured methods. It ensures that software works well, is easy to use, and can be updated when needed.

Why is Software Engineering Important?  
1. Makes Software Reliable – Helps prevent crashes and errors.  
2. Speeds Up Development – Uses smart methods to build software faster.  
3. Handles Complexity – Breaks big problems into smaller, manageable parts.  
4. Improves Security – Protects against hacking and data loss.  
5. Supports Growth – Allows software to grow as users increase.  
6. Saves Money & Time – Prevents costly mistakes and rework.  
7. Drives Innovation – Powers new technologies like AI, apps, and cloud computing.  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1950s – Birth of Programming 

2. 1968 – The Term "Software Engineering" is Born 

3. 2001 – Agile Development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.  
1. Planning – Decide what the software should do and why it’s needed.  
2. Requirement Analysis** – Gather details on what users need from the software.  
3. Design – Create a blueprint for how the software will work.  
4. Coding – Developers write the actual code.  
5. Testing – Check for bugs and make sure everything works correctly.  
6. Deployment – Release the software for users to use.  
7. Maintenance – Fix issues and update the software over time.  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Process: Waterfall follows a step-by-step approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Agile is more flexible, allowing work to be done in small sprint cycles. 
Changes: Waterfall makes it hard to change things once a phase is finished. Agile allows easy changes and adjustments based on feedback.  
Speed: Waterfall is slower because everything is planned upfront. Agile is faster since features are built and improved continuously.  
Testing: In Waterfall, testing happens after development is complete. In Agile, testing happens throughout the process.  
Best for: Waterfall works well for large projects with clear requirements, while Agile is better for projects that need flexibility and frequent updates.  


- Waterfall is ideal for projects like banking systems, where every step must be carefully planned and tested before release.  
- Agile is great for mobile app development, where user feedback helps improve features quickly.  


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team
1. Software Developer  
   - Writes and maintains code.  
   - Builds software features and fixes bugs.  
   - Works with the team to improve performance.  

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer 
   - Tests software to find and report bugs.  
   - Ensures the software works correctly and meets requirements.  
   - Automates testing for efficiency.  

3. Project Manager (PM)  
   - Plans and organizes the project.  
   - Ensures deadlines are met.  
   - Communicates with the team and stakeholders.  


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)  
   - Help developers write, test, and debug code faster.  
   - Provide tools like auto-complete, error checking, and a built-in compiler.  
   - Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.  

2. Version Control Systems (VCS) 
   - Track changes in code, so mistakes can be undone.  
   - Allow multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.  
   - Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab.  
 
IDEs make coding easier, while VCS keeps track of changes and helps teamwork!

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 
1. Debugging and Fixing Bugs  
   - Solution: Use debugging tools, write clean code, and test often.  

2. Tight Deadlines 
   - Solution: Plan tasks well, break work into small steps, and use Agile methods.  

3. Keeping Up with New Technologies  
   - Solution: Read tech blogs, take courses, and practice new skills.  

4. Code Collaboration Issues  
   - Solution: Use Version Control Systems (e.g., Git) and communicate with the team.  

5. Security Risks  
   - Solution: Follow secure coding practices and test for vulnerabilities.  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing  
   - Catches bugs early and ensures each part works correctly.  

2. Integration Testing  
   - Checks if different parts of the software work together.   

3. System Testing 
   - Tests the entire software as a whole.  
   - Ensures all features work properly before release.  

4. Acceptance Testing  
   - Verifies if the software meets user needs.  
   - Confirms it’s ready for real-world use.  


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear and effective prompts to get the best responses from AI models. It involves structuring questions or instructions in a way that guides the AI to produce accurate and useful answers.  

Why is Prompt Engineering Important? 
1. Improves AI Responses   
2. Saves Time   
3. Enhances AI Applications  
4. Optimizes AI Performance   

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:  
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt: 
"Explain how artificial intelligence is used in healthcare."

Why is it Better?  
- More Specific – Focuses on AI in healthcare instead of all technology.  
- Clearer – AI's role is the main topic.  
- Concise – Short and direct, making it easy for AI to understand.  

A clear, specific prompt gets better, more useful answers!
